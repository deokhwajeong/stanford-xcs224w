Deokhwa Jeong | PMP | Software Engineer

I worked at LG Electronics (Smart TV division), starting at the R&D Center and later moving to the Seoul headquarters, where I led cross-functional initiatives in product and software development.
During my M.S. studies in Molecular & Cell Biology, I conducted research on 3D cell structure reconstruction using High-Voltage Electron Microscopy and Java-based modeling.
I'm currently deep-diving into Machine Learning with Graphs at Stanford.

## Background
- M.S. in Molecular & Cell Biology
- 10+ years at LG Electronics as a Software Engineer & Project Manager
- PMP Certified  

## Currently Learning
- Graph Neural Networks (XCS224W, Stanford)  
- Python, PyTorch Geometric
- Preparing for the GRE as part of my continued academic development  

## Coming Soon
- Bio data meets TV viewership data: Graph-based project  
- Java-based 3D reconstruction of cell ultrastructure from tilt-series HVEM 
- Tableau dashboards (TV feature analysis)
